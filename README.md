# SoC-project
We started the SoC learning about the know how's of Time Series and datas and learnt a lot of new definitions such as metrics/events/ cross sectional data. Also,I saw what to look for in time series datas at first sight such as trends, cyclic fluctuations and seasonal patterns.Overall, this was a good start and I had no doubts in this week.

In this week, I was introduced to a lot of traditional time series forecasting methods and where did they originate from such as Autoregression, moving average, seasons and based on this learnt various models such as ARMA and going all the way to the vectorised approach such as VARMAX.
This week was particularly fun and challenging since I didn't have prior experience of working with so many libraries at once.
We stepped up the pace in Week 3 going into the fundamentals of Deep learning and it's frameworks,also saw the common approaches to optimise an algorithm such as loss function/gradient descent.I also got introduced to tensorflow's Keras API and was surprised with how easier it was with Keras.

Lastly, In week 4 I started to become acquainted with Neural networks and the math behind it.It involved a bit of linear algebra and I finally got to know the meaning behind weights,biases, regularisation, forward and back propagation and also loss functions.
To implement them using Tensorflow was particularly challenging and I'll have to practice more to get used to it.
Overall, this was my progress so far till the checkpoint 1 and I'm glad I chose this project. Looking forward to learn and implement a lot more in the coming weeks.
